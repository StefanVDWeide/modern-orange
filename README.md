# Modern Orange

Modern Orange is a modern Hacker News client built with Nuxt 3 and based on the [official HN API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

It tries to stay true to the original minimal design that everybody loves but adds new features such as dark mode, better usability on larger screens and preview images for each story.
