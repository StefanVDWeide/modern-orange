# Modern Orange

Modern Orange is a modern Hacker News client built with Nuxt 3 and based on the [official HN API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

It tries to stay true to the original minimal design that everybody loves but adds new features such as dark mode, better usability on larger screens and preview images for each story.

## Missing Features
Because the offical API does not support user login, features such as commeting, voting and editing your profile are not supported. When (if) login is added to the API these features will be added.


## Local Development
## Setup
